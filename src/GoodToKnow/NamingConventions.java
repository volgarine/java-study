   /* In programming, naming convention refers to a set of rules and guidelines that are used to give meaningful and consistent
   names to variables, methods, classes, and other programming elements. Adhering to a naming convention makes code more readable
   and understandable by other programmers, and can also help to prevent naming conflicts.

    Some common naming conventions in Java are:

    * camelCase: the first letter of the first word is in lowercase and the first letter of subsequent words is capitalized.
    For example: firstName, accountBalance, customerAddress.

    * PascalCase: the first letter of each word is capitalized. For example: CustomerAddress, AccountBalance, FirstName.

    * snake_case: all letters are in lowercase, and words are separated by underscores. For example: first_name, account_balance, customer_address.

    * Upper Case: all letters are in uppercase. This is typically used for constants. For example: MAX_SIZE, PI.

    In addition to these conventions, it's important to choose names that are descriptive and meaningful. Variable names should
    reflect their purpose, and method and class names should describe what they do.

    By following a consistent naming convention and using descriptive names, you can make your code more readable and maintainable,
    and make it easier for other developers to understand and work with your code.*/
